With bloodshot eyes, I watch you sleeping
The warmth I feel beside me is slowly fading
Would she hear me if I called her name?
Would she hold me if she knew my shame?
There's always something different going on
The path I walk's in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make it better?
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls the guilty to come home
The moments died, I hear no screaming
The visions left inside me are slowly fading
Would she hear me if I called her name?
Would she hold me if she knew my shame?
There's always something different going on
The path I walk's in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make it better?
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls the guilty to come home
Would she hear me if I called her name?
Would she hold me if she knew my shame?
There's always something different going on
The path I walk's in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make it better?
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls the guilty
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall...
